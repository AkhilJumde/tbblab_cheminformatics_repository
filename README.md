# TBBLab Resources and Tutorials

List of useful resources for the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology field


## [Linux](https://github.com/fpolticelli/tbblab_repository/blob/main/linux.md)
- Linux is an open source operating system (OS). An OS is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

## [Python](https://github.com/fpolticelli/tbblab_repository/blob/main/python.md)
- Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language, frequently used for scientific applications. It is widely used in academia and scientific projects because it is easy to write and performs well.

## [Sequence Analysis]()
-  Process of subjecting a DNA, RNA or peptide sequence to any of a wide range of analytical methods to understand its features, function, structure, or evolution. 

## [Molecular Graphics](https://github.com/fpolticelli/tbblab_repository/blob/main/molecular_graphics.md)
- Molecular Graphics programs are used to visualize biomolecules models.

## [Protein Structure Prediction](https://github.com/fpolticelli/tbblab_repository/blob/main/protein_modelling.md)
- Protein structure prediction is the inference of the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence.

## [Cheminformatics](https://github.com/fpolticelli/tbblab_repository/blob/main/cheminformatics.md)
- Cheminformatics uses computer and information science techniques for the collection, storage, analysis, and manipulation of chemical data.

## [Molecular Docking](https://github.com/fpolticelli/tbblab_repository/blob/main/molecular_docking.md)
- Molecular Docking is a method which predicts the preferred orientation of one molecule to a second when bound to each other to form a stable complex.

## [Molecular Dynamics](https://github.com/fpolticelli/tbblab_repository/blob/main/molecular_dynamics.md)
- Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a computer simulation method for analysing the physical movements of atoms and molecules.

## [Machine Learning](https://github.com/fpolticelli/tbblab_repository/blob/main/machine_learning.md)
- Machine learning (ML) algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions.

## [Protein-Protein Interaction](https://github.com/fpolticelli/tbblab_repository/blob/main/proteins_interactions.md)
- Proteinâ€“protein interaction (PPI) predictions are methods used to predict the outcome of pairs or groups of protein interactions.
