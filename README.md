# TBBLab Resources and Tutorials

List of useful resources for the field of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology 



## [Linux](https://github.com/fpolticelli/tbblab_repository/blob/main/linux.md)
- Linux is an open source operating system (OS). An OS is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.
## [Python](https://github.com/fpolticelli/tbblab_repository/blob/main/python.md)
- Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language, frequently used for scientific applications. It is widely used in academia and scientific projects because it is easy to write and performs well.
## [Molecular Graphics](https://github.com/fpolticelli/tbblab_repository/blob/main/molecular_graphics.md)
- Molecular Graphics programs are used to visualize biomolecules models.
## [Protein Structure Prediction](https://github.com/fpolticelli/tbblab_repository/blob/main/protein_modelling.md)
- Protein structure prediction is the inference of the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence.
## [Cheminformatics](https://github.com/fpolticelli/tbblab_repository/blob/main/cheminformatics.md)
- Cheminformatics uses computer and information science techniques for the collection, storage, analysis, and manipulation of chemical data.
## [Molecular Docking](https://github.com/fpolticelli/tbblab_repository/blob/main/molecular_docking.md)
- Molecular Docking is a method which predicts the preferred orientation of one molecule to a second when bound to each other to form a stable complex.
## [Molecular Dynamics](https://github.com/fpolticelli/tbblab_repository/blob/main/molecular_dynamics.md)
- Molecular dynamics (MD) is a computer simulation method for analyzing the physical movements of atoms and molecules.
